# Hylios
Hylios is a little tool designed to build an assault dictionary based on your knowledge of the target.

**You can use the app [here](https://hylios.web.app)**

The project is made with **angular**, and it is just a web app.

The project is built to optimize dictionnary, with the simple idea that a large majority of password have the **same scheme** : personnal information + personnal number, for example **felix80** *(pet name + country number)*




## Getting started

![Screenhot of the app](https://github.com/Iridium-dev/hylios/blob/Iridium-dev-patch-1/principalScreen.png)

Hylios is divided in five parts.

### First part : Principal informations

Here you enter basically textual informations about the target, like pet name, Nickname, Children name, Wife name, or if the target is an instution or an enterprise, CEO name, the name of the city where target is located.

**To write data, click on the right of the $ sign, tap your word and then press enter**

The more knowledge you can get of the target,the more chance you to get the good password.

### Second part : Complement informations

In this part, you can enter informations like contry number, birthday date, wedding date.

**To write data, click on the right of the $ sign, tap your word and then press enter**

### Third part : Settings

Not a lot to say, if you click on a setting, you disable or you enable it, for **Special char setting** a input box appear and you can change the special char to put at the end of passwords.

### Fourth part : Information

This part contains the version of hylios, but the most important info is **the number of password** that are generated by the tool.

### Fifth part : Sandbox

In this alpha version, this part is almost **completly useless** but in further version it can be useful ...
